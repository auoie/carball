# Handoff: how to resume this project

**Goal:** a web game cloning Rocket League's physics, camera, controls and competitive multiplayer.
**Plan:** patch RocketSim with verified differences → WASM; own arena mesh; Three.js; authoritative server.
**Status (2026-10-06):** physics reverse engineering complete; our arena mesh is generated and validated
(`out/arena/`); RocketSim is forked into `engine/` with every verified patch and tests (`engine/README.md`).
The engine also builds to WebAssembly with a JS API (`engine/build-wasm/rlengine.mjs`).
Next: browser freeplay (§8), then camera/controls/netcode reverse engineering (§3, §4, §6).

Read in this order: `notes/roadmap.md` (what's left) → `notes/physics-values.md` (all values, formulas,
RocketSim comparison) → `notes/arena.md` → `notes/findings.md` (binary/package internals, addresses).

## Locations
| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Game install (Windows copy) | `/mnt/primary/home/arch/documents/binaries/rocket-league/rocketleague` |
| Exe | `.../Binaries/Win64/RocketLeague.exe` (build 2026-06-16, image base 0x140000000) |
| Packages | `.../TAGame/CookedPCConsole/*.upk` |
| Replay dataset (116 GB zip, ~120k replays 2021–Sep 2025, `1v1/ 2v2/ 3v3/` + `metadata.jsonl`) | `/mnt/primary/home/arch/documents/rocket_league_replays/high-level-rocket-league-replay-dataset.zip` |
| Ghidra project (fully analysed, natives named) | `ghidra/RocketLeague` (git-ignored) |
| Decrypted packages | `out/decrypted/` (git-ignored): TAGame, GameInfo_Soccar_SF, GameInfo_Default_SF, Body_Octane_SF, Stadium_P, Engine, Core, ProjectX, Mutators_SF, Startup |
| Package AES key | `out/rlupktool_key.bin` (public RLUPKTool key; git-ignored) |
| Decompiled C | `out/decomp/<name>@<addr>.c` (git-ignored) |
| Extracted arena meshes (measurement only, never ship) | `out/arena_local/*.obj` (git-ignored) |

Scratchpad copies (RocketSim and RLUPKTool clones, extracted replays, `states.csv`) are temporary.
Regenerate: `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ZealanL/RocketSim`; replays via Python `zipfile`
from the dataset zip (newest by `metadata.jsonl` `data.date`).

## Tools (run Python scripts from `scripts/`; plain `python3`, not `-I`)
```sh

# zsh does not word-split $VAR: use ${=VAR} when passing address lists.

## Gotchas
- Units: uu; Bullet = uu × 0.02. Forces/impulses in data are uu × mass (car 180, ball 30).
- UE3 shapes get PhysX skin +0.025 BT (+1.25 uu/side); spheres then −0.04 in Psyonix's converter.
- Package quirks: UProperty has an extra FString name; Context/ClassContext tokens have an extra flag
  byte; bytecode tokens are shuffled (map in findings.md); imported structs live in ProjectX/Core.
- KSphereElem `TM` matrix reads as a permutation = identity (FPlane stored W-first).
- Replays: angular velocity is rad/s × 100; car states replicate every ~0.067–0.1 s (not every frame);
  high-speed bounce samples can be extrapolated past walls; use slow/sustained contact.
- Level actors with `RF_HasStack` have an FStateFrame before NetIndex (props.py handles it).
- Addresses are valid for this exe build only.
- Keep Psyonix material local: decrypted packages, key, meshes, decompiled code are git-ignored.
- The user commits work themselves; leave changes uncommitted unless asked.
- The user chose to fork RocketSim despite its README's request (2026-10-06); don't re-ask.
- Engine changes are marked `RL PATCH`; regenerate `engine/rocketsim-rl-patches.diff` after changing them.
