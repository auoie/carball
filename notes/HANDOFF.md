# Handoff: how to resume this project

**Goal:** a web game cloning Rocket League's physics, camera, controls and competitive multiplayer.
**Plan:** forked RocketSim (`engine/`) with verified patches → native game server + WebAssembly clients
(bit-identical); own arena mesh; Three.js browser client (`client/`).
**Status (2026-10-06):** physics reverse engineering complete; our arena mesh is generated and validated
(`out/arena/`); RocketSim is forked into `engine/` with every verified patch and tests (`engine/README.md`).
The engine also builds to WebAssembly with a JS API (`engine/build-wasm/rlengine.mjs`). Native and WebAssembly
builds simulate bit-identically (the game server will be native, the clients WebAssembly).
Browser freeplay works (`client/`, TypeScript + Vite + Three.js; see `client/README.md`). The camera is the
game's own: decompiled from UnrealScript and ported (`client/src/camera/rlCamera.ts`, algorithm in `notes/camera.md`).
**Last state (2026-10-06):** ported the game's camera (user had said the provisional one "feels terrible"), then
added a settings menu (Esc) at the user's request so they can use their own controls/camera settings: rebinding,
camera sliders, deadzones/sensitivities, saved in localStorage. If they report camera problems, compare against
`out/decomp/camera_script.txt`. Possible follow-ups: dodge deadzone (engine CarConfig.dodgeDeadzone, not exposed),
import of the game's own settings, mouse look/swivel.
Next options: camera extras (swivel/look, rear cam), controls/input shaping (§4), replay validation (§7),
netcode + native server (§6), competitive layer (§9).

Read in this order: `notes/roadmap.md` (what's left) → `notes/physics-values.md` (all values, formulas,
RocketSim comparison) → `notes/arena.md` → `notes/camera.md` → `notes/findings.md` (binary/package internals, addresses)
→ `engine/README.md` → `client/README.md`.

## Session conventions and decisions
- The user commits work themselves. Don't commit, and don't touch the git index (no `git rm --cached`, no staging).
- RocketSim was forked knowingly, despite its README's request. The server will be native, the clients WebAssembly,
  and they must stay bit-identical: run `engine/tests/check_native_wasm.sh` after engine changes.
- The user values strict static analysis and tests: keep `cd client && npm run check` and `npm run e2e` green.
- Decompiled game code stays local (`out/decomp/`, git-ignored): camera script in `out/decomp/camera_script.txt`
  and `camera_base_script.txt`.

## Gotchas
- Units: uu; Bullet = uu × 0.02. Forces/impulses in data are uu × mass (car 180, ball 30).
- UE3 shapes get PhysX skin +0.025 BT (+1.25 uu/side); spheres then −0.04 in Psyonix's converter.
- Package quirks: UProperty has an extra FString name; Context/ClassContext tokens have an extra flag
  byte; bytecode tokens are shuffled (map in findings.md); imported structs live in ProjectX/Core.
- KSphereElem `TM` matrix reads as a permutation = identity (FPlane stored W-first).
- Replays: angular velocity is rad/s × 100; car states replicate every ~0.067–0.1 s (not every frame);
  high-speed bounce samples can be extrapolated past walls; use slow/sustained contact.
- Level actors with `RF_HasStack` have an FStateFrame before NetIndex (props.py handles it).
- Addresses are valid for this exe build only.
- Keep Psyonix material local: decrypted packages, key, meshes, decompiled code are git-ignored.
- The user commits work themselves; leave changes uncommitted unless asked.
- `pkill -f PATTERN` kills its own shell if PATTERN appears anywhere in the same command line. Use a bracket
  trick (`pkill -f 'vite previe[w]'`) and don't start the process in the same command.
- Emscripten: `PATH=/usr/lib/emscripten:$PATH` (not on PATH in non-login shells). Bindings generate TS types
  (`--emit-tsd *.d.mts`; typed arrays via `EMSCRIPTEN_DECLARE_VAL_TYPE`). After changing `engine/wasm/bindings.cpp`,
  rebuild `engine/build-wasm` (targets `rlengine`, `rlengine_web`) before running the client.
- Determinism pitfalls (native vs WebAssembly): platform libm (fixed: `engine/detmath`), Bullet SSE paths (fixed:
  `BT_DISABLE_SIMD`), `std::` random distributions/shuffle/`default_random_engine`, function-argument evaluation
  order, uninitialized fields. Never `-ffast-math`.
- UnrealScript disassembly: Rocket League's extended-native tokens are 0x70–0x7F (fixed in `ubytecode.py`).
  Unknown tokens `0x52`, `0x5b` remain. Most game-feel logic (camera, car impacts) is script, not native.
- Playwright uses the system Chrome (`channel: "chrome"`, swiftshader). Screenshots via a temporary spec file in
  `client/e2e/` (delete after). Headless Chrome CLI screenshots also work (`--use-angle=swiftshader`).
- The user chose to fork RocketSim despite its README's request (2026-10-06); don't re-ask.
- Engine changes are marked `RL PATCH`; regenerate `engine/rocketsim-rl-patches.diff` after changing them.
