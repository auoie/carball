# Handoff: how to resume this project

## Next (2026-10-07, evening)
- **Where:** the repository is on the data drive, `/mnt/primary/home/arch/rocket-league-reverse-engineering`, the
  same path from Arch and WSL. `engine/build` and `engine/build-wasm` were rebuilt at this path (the old ones are
  renamed `*-old-documents-path`, and `engine/build-wsl`, `engine/build-wasm-wsl` are leftovers: all can be deleted).
  `~/Documents/rocket-league-reverse-engineering` on the Arch NVMe is an old backup.
- **Live game (Windows, WSL) works:** `tools/physlog/run_wsl.sh SCENARIO...` plays scenarios in freeplay over rcon,
  copies the recordings to `out/live/` and validates them (`tools/physlog/README.md` "Driving it from WSL": game
  windowed on the second monitor, never focused by scripts; rcon whitelist; the plugin unpauses itself). Results so
  far (`notes/validation.md` findings 23–24, engine patches 38–42): steering, air control, powerslide exact;
  jumps and flips exact except landings.
- **Open, from the live recordings:**
  - **car body vs floor** (the hitbox, not the wheels): in `--continuous` mode the only drift in `jumps`/`flip_cancel`
    comes from a flip putting the nose into the floor and the car tumbling after a landing (up to 260 uu/s). Some
    single-tick spikes in the per-tick mode are artifacts (Bullet's persistent contact carries our own history; the
    nose-first landing at `flip_cancel` tick 456 is exact in continuous mode). Also ~1.3 uu/s for ~10 ticks after a
    two-wheel sideways landing (wheel friction or braking with fewer than 3 wheels down);
  - `walls` (p99 1.9 uu/s, one wheel-contact mismatch) and `ball_roof` (one ball tick of 95 uu/s at the contact);
  - a scenario for the ball rolling on the corner ramp (the old `steer_sweep` recording showed 1–14 uu/s per tick
    there, but its ball also started inside the wall);
  - `steer` once per other car body (non-Octane steering, finding 21), flip cancel exactly at the 4th vs 5th tick,
    the goal-wall wobble, `HandlingPresetXOffset`.
- **Then, static:** diff stock Bullet (the version the game is based on, built with MSVC) against the executable
  function by function (Ghidra BSim or BinDiff), to list every Bullet function Psyonix changed. That finds physics
  changes systematically instead of one replay mismatch at a time.
- **Later, low priority:** track the ball's orientation in the engine (`ArenaConfig::noBallRot = false`; physics
  unchanged, but the orientation becomes synced state, so the client's `ballSpin.ts` integration could go).

**Goal:** a web game cloning Rocket League's physics, camera, controls and competitive multiplayer.
**Plan:** forked RocketSim (`engine/`) with verified patches → native game server + WebAssembly clients
(bit-identical); own arena mesh; Three.js browser client (`client/`).
**Status (2026-10-06):** physics reverse engineering complete; our arena mesh is generated and validated
(`out/arena/`); RocketSim is forked into `engine/` with every verified patch and tests (`engine/README.md`).
The engine also builds to WebAssembly with a JS API (`engine/build-wasm/rlengine.mjs`). Native and WebAssembly
builds simulate bit-identically (the game server will be native, the clients WebAssembly).
Browser freeplay works (`client/`, TypeScript + Vite + Three.js; see `client/README.md`). The camera is the
game's own: decompiled from UnrealScript and ported (`client/src/camera/rlCamera.ts`, algorithm in `notes/camera.md`).
**Last state (2026-10-06):** multiplayer step 1 done: snapshot restore is exact (engine patches 23–26,
`engine/tests/rollback.cpp`; in-place load ~5 µs). Step 2 done: the game's netcode is decoded (`notes/netcode.md`).
Step 3 done: native server (`server/`, Rust, WebTransport; `server/README.md`), protocol v1 (`protocol/`), browser
online mode with prediction and rollback (`client/src/game/online.ts`, `client/src/net/`); step 4's core (the
predictor) is in and exact for the local car. Next: step 5.
Replay validation (§7) done (`notes/validation.md`, `engine/build/replay_validate`): ball physics exact, driving within
~1%; fixed the car–ball hit impulse (start-of-tick velocities, patch 28: the ball was bouncy on the car) and added the
game's input bytes (patch 29). Then: the ball sleeps like in the game (patch 30); car wobble at goal walls traced to
the vehicle model (same on the game's mesh); the client predictor resyncs when the server is ahead (stalled tab). Then the vehicle update decompiled
and matched to the game's Bullet vehicle (patch 31; replays: wall/curve error 3× lower). Then: powerslide,
jumps, flips and pinches checked (all match; their errors were replay timing, now reconstructed or fitted by the
validator); steering reverted to the game's average angle (patch 8 revised: the earlier replay test was confounded);
wall-grip condition (patch 32). Car–car checked with a new validator pass (`--carcar`, extractor `--demos`): bumps
match; the demo cone is now tested at the time of impact (patch 33) and supersonic lasts 1 s below 2200 (patch 34),
both from the code and confirmed by replay demos. The arena mesh now uses the game's tessellation (Bézier arcs;
`notes/arena.md`), which brought walls/curves to 0.046 uu, as on the game's own mesh. Then: double jumps (start
timing), boost pad pickup radius (patch 35), kickoff ball height and the 4 s kickoff countdown (patches 36, 37;
server waits 3.0 s after a goal; protocol version 2), other bodies (`--bodies`) and input changes checked.
Open points: `notes/roadmap.md` §7 "Open". Car position error vs replays
now ~0.010 uu flat, 0.046 walls/curves, 0.020 goals (median after ~4 ticks; `notes/validation.md`). A second Claude
session did client visuals (ball spin, hex walls, placeholder car models) in client/src.
Agreed multiplayer plan: (1) exact restore ✓, (2) decode the
game's netcode (input buffer, client sim-time adjustment, remote car/ball correction), (3) native authoritative
server + browser transport, (4) client prediction + rollback, (5) in-process network tests with scripted
latency/jitter/loss. Then replay validation (§7) with numbers, then the competitive layer (§9). The user wants
accuracy settled by deterministic, verifiable tests, not by their perception.

Read in this order: `notes/roadmap.md` (what's left) → `notes/physics-values.md` (all values, formulas,
RocketSim comparison) → `notes/arena.md` → `notes/camera.md` → `notes/findings.md` (binary/package internals, addresses)
→ `notes/input.md` → `notes/netcode.md` → `notes/validation.md` → `engine/README.md` → `client/README.md`.

## Session conventions and decisions
- The user commits work themselves. Don't commit, and don't touch the git index (no `git rm --cached`, no staging).
- RocketSim was forked knowingly, despite its README's request. The server will be native, the clients WebAssembly,
  and they must stay bit-identical: run `engine/tests/check_native_wasm.sh` after engine changes.
- The user values strict static analysis and tests: keep `cd client && npm run check` and `npm run e2e` green.
- Decompiled game code stays local (`out/decomp/`, git-ignored): camera script in `out/decomp/camera_script.txt`
  and `camera_base_script.txt`.

## Gotchas
- Units: uu; Bullet = uu × 0.02. Forces/impulses in data are uu × mass (car 180, ball 30).
- UE3 shapes get PhysX skin +0.025 BT (+1.25 uu/side); spheres then −0.04 in Psyonix's converter.
- Package quirks: UProperty has an extra FString name; Context/ClassContext tokens have an extra flag
  byte; bytecode tokens are shuffled (map in findings.md); imported structs live in ProjectX/Core.
- KSphereElem `TM` matrix reads as a permutation = identity (FPlane stored W-first).
- Replays: angular velocity is rad/s × 100; car states replicate every ~0.067–0.1 s (not every frame);
  high-speed bounce samples can be extrapolated past walls; use slow/sustained contact.
- Level actors with `RF_HasStack` have an FStateFrame before NetIndex (props.py handles it).
- Addresses are valid for this exe build only.
- Keep Psyonix material local: decrypted packages, key, meshes, decompiled code are git-ignored.
- The user commits work themselves; leave changes uncommitted unless asked.
- `pkill -f PATTERN` kills its own shell if PATTERN appears anywhere in the same command line. Use a bracket
  trick (`pkill -f 'vite previe[w]'`) and don't start the process in the same command.
- Emscripten: `PATH=/usr/lib/emscripten:$PATH` (not on PATH in non-login shells). Bindings generate TS types
  (`--emit-tsd *.d.mts`; typed arrays via `EMSCRIPTEN_DECLARE_VAL_TYPE`). After changing `engine/wasm/bindings.cpp`,
  rebuild `engine/build-wasm` (targets `rlengine`, `rlengine_web`) before running the client.
- Determinism pitfalls (native vs WebAssembly): platform libm (fixed: `engine/detmath`), Bullet SSE paths (fixed:
  `BT_DISABLE_SIMD`), `std::` random distributions/shuffle/`default_random_engine`, function-argument evaluation
  order, uninitialized fields. Never `-ffast-math`.
- UnrealScript disassembly: Rocket League's extended-native tokens are 0x70–0x7F (fixed in `ubytecode.py`).
  Unknown tokens `0x52`, `0x5b` remain. Most game-feel logic (camera, car impacts) is script, not native.
- Playwright's system Chrome reads real gamepads plugged into the machine (the user's controller once reset the
  car mid-test). `client/e2e/fixtures.ts` stubs `navigator.getGamepads`; import `test` from there.
- Playwright uses the system Chrome (`channel: "chrome"`, swiftshader). Screenshots via a temporary spec file in
  `client/e2e/` (delete after). Headless Chrome CLI screenshots also work (`--use-angle=swiftshader`).
- The user chose to fork RocketSim despite its README's request (2026-10-06); don't re-ask.
- Engine changes are marked `RL PATCH`; regenerate `engine/rocketsim-rl-patches.diff` after changing them.
