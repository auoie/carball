# Game protocol (version 7)

Client ↔ server over **WebTransport** (HTTP/3, QUIC). All integers little-endian. Implemented in
`server/src/protocol.rs` (Rust) and `client/src/net/protocol.ts` (TypeScript); `vectors.json` holds byte-exact
samples both test suites check. Design follows the game's netcode (`notes/netcode.md`).

## Connection
1. The client opens a WebTransport session to `https://HOST:PORT/play`. In development the server uses a
   self-signed certificate (valid 14 days, regenerated at start) and the client passes its SHA-256 hash
   (`serverCertificateHashes`); the dev server publishes it at `http://HOST:INFO_PORT/info`.
2. The client opens one bidirectional stream, the **control stream** (reliable, ordered), and sends `Hello`.
3. The server answers `Welcome`, then sends `Update` datagrams; the client sends `Inputs` datagrams.

## Control stream messages
Framed as `u16 length` + message (`length` counts the message, which starts with its type byte).

| Type | Direction | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `0x01 Hello` | C→S | `u16 version`, `u8 team` (0 blue, 1 orange, 255 any), `u8 body` (0 Octane … 5 Merc), `f32 dodgeDeadzone`, `f32 steeringSensitivity`, `f32 airControlSensitivity` |
| `0x02 ResetInputBuffer` | C→S | nothing: the client had a hitch (over 0.1 s between its frames) 2 s ago; the server resets its jitter buffer to the initial estimate (as the game's `ServerResetInputBuffer`) |
| `0x81 Welcome` | S→C | `u16 version`, `u32 carId`, `u8 tickRate` (120), `u32 frame`, `u32 n`, `n` bytes engine snapshot |
| `0x82 World` | S→C | `u32 frame`, `u32 n`, `n` bytes engine snapshot (the set of cars changed: load it as the state after `frame`) |
| `0x83 Event` | S→C | `u32 serverTick`, `u8 kind` (0 goal, 1 demo), then goal: `u8 team`; demo: `u32 attacker`, `u32 victim` |
| `0x84 Match` | S→C | `u32 serverTick`, `u8 phase` (0 kickoff countdown, 1 playing, 2 after a goal, 3 time up: the round ends when the ball touches the ground, 4 ended), `u8 flags` (1 overtime, 2 clock running, 4 forfeit: the losing team left), `u32 clockTicks` (regulation: ticks left of 36000; overtime: ticks played), `u8 scoreBlue`, `u8 scoreOrange`, `u8 winner` (255 none). Sent after the welcome, and whenever the phase, the scores, the flags or the clock's shown second change (regulation rounds up, overtime down) |

`frame` is in the **client's** frame numbering: the snapshot is the world after the server applied that client's
input frame `frame` (0 before any). Engine snapshots: `Arena::Serialize` (exact, `engine/README.md`).

## Datagrams
| Type | Direction | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `0x01 Inputs` | C→S | `u32 timestamp` (client ms), `u32 firstFrame`, `u8 count` (≤ 10), `count` × input frame |
| `0x81 Update` | S→C | `u32 serverTick`, `u32 ackFrame`, `u32 receivedFrame`, `u32 echoTimestamp`, `u16 echoDelay` (ms), `u8 bufferTarget`, `u8 bufferSize`, `u8 part`, `u8 parts`, then network state bytes |

**Input frame** (7 bytes, consecutive frames from `firstFrame`): `i8 throttle, steer, pitch, yaw, roll,
dodgeForward` as the game's input byte (`Vehicle_TA.SetVehicleInput`): q = round(value × 127) for value ≥ 0 and
round(value × 128) below, halves up, −128..127 (dodgeForward: the dodge's forward input, −pitch made a byte on its own
as the game's DodgeForward, so q(−p) and not −q(p); version 6); then `u8` bits: 1 jump, 2 boost, 4 handbrake, 8 air pitch safety. Decoded as `q / 127` or
`q × (1/128)` (32-bit float). The engine quantizes every axis the same way each tick, so decoded values pass through
unchanged and the client predicts with exactly what the server applies.
The client sends its unacknowledged frames (the newest 10) at its input rate (60 Hz).

**Update**: the network state (`engine/net/NetState.h`) is the server's world after `serverTick`; for this client
that is the state after its input frame `ackFrame` (the last frame the server consumed for it; 0 = none yet).
`receivedFrame` is the highest input frame received, so the client stops resending frames up to it.
`echoTimestamp` is the newest `Inputs.timestamp` received and `echoDelay` how long the server held it, so
ping = now − echoTimestamp − echoDelay. A large update is split into `parts`, each a complete network state for
some of the bodies; parts apply independently. Every network state also carries the kickoff countdown (ticks left;
cars get no input while it runs; version 2), and each car's wheel contacts from its previous tick with their normals
(the car's next tick uses them; version 3), and whether the jump button was released during the car's current jump
(the jump then ends at its minimum time; version 4), and a demolished car's respawn spot selection (the steer input
past ±0.3 picks the next spot on that side for the first 2.5 s of the 3 s, then the spot locks) and its flip reset
count (version 5), and each car's and the ball's spawn counter (placements by a kickoff reset, a respawn or a ball
reset: a client draws a correction that changes it at once and smooths every other), and whether demolished cars'
respawns are held (after a goal, until the kickoff), with the match message (version 6). Version 7: the engine turns
the ball (its orientation, already in every network state and snapshot, is now simulated), so the client draws it.

What an update carries (the game's rates, `notes/netcode.md`): the ball every update (60 Hz); cars within 1000 uu of
the ball every update, other cars and the boost pads every 8 ticks (15 Hz).
